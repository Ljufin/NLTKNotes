# NLTK Notes
This collection of Jupyter notebooks are my notes for the Natural Language
Processing with Python by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper. The book can
be found at http://www.nltk.org/book/.

The structure and nearly all of the example codes comes directly from the book.
I also paraphrase the parts that I think are important. I use text data from http://www.gutenberg.org
